Authentication: Most endpoints require JWT Bearer token.

**Key Features**:
- RESTful design with JSON request/response format
- JWT-based stateless authentication
- Comprehensive error handling with consistent error format
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for interactive exploration
- Support for both local and cloud-hosted PostgreSQL databases
- Rate limiting and CORS configuration for production deployments

---

## Endpoints

### Auth

- POST `/api/auth/register`
  - Body: `{ name, email, password }`
  - 200: `{ token, id, name, email, role, isAdmin }`
  - Notes: Server assigns `role=USER` and `isAdmin=false`.

- POST `/api/auth/login`
  - Body: `{ email, password }`
  - 200: same response as register

- POST `/api/auth/validate`
  - Header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
  - 200: same response as register

### Reference

- GET `/api/countries?q=&page=&size=`
  - 200: list of countries for selectors

### Tariff

- GET `/api/tariff-rate/lookup?importerIso2=&originIso2=&hsCode=`
  - 200: `{ mfn: {...}, pref: {...}|null, agreement: {...}|null }`
  - Notes: Simple selection (no date window logic yet).

- POST `/api/tariff-rate/calculate`
  - Body: `{ totalValue, mfnRate, prefRate, rvcThreshold, materialCost, labourCost, overheadCost, profit, otherCosts, fob }`
  - 200: `{ basis, appliedRate, totalDuty, rvc, rvcThreshold }`
  - Logic: `RVC = (material+labour+overhead+profit+other)/fob*100`; if `RVC >= rvcThreshold` and `prefRate` present then `basis=PREF`, else `basis=MFN`.

  -d '{
    "query": "What is the tariff rate for importing coffee from Brazil to USA?"
  }'
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "response": "To provide you with the exact tariff rate for importing coffee from Brazil to the USA, I need the specific HS code for the type of coffee you're importing. Coffee products have different HS codes depending on whether they are roasted, decaffeinated, or in bean form. Could you specify the type of coffee, or would you like me to search for relevant HS codes?",
  "conversationId": "conv_abc123xyz",

  "processingTimeMs": 1200,
  "success": true
}
```

If you need the tariff rate for importing these from Brazil to the USA, I can look that up for you.",
  "conversationId": "conv_abc123xyz",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-19T14:30:15",
  "toolsUsed": ["findHsCodeForProduct"],
  "processingTimeMs": 1800,

}
```

}
```

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage:

- **Per Minute**: 10 requests
- **Per Hour**: 100 requests

When rate limits are exceeded, the API returns a `429 Too Many Requests` error with information about when you can retry.

---

## Error Handling

All errors follow a consistent format:

```json
{
  "error": "ErrorType",
  "message": "User-friendly error message",
  "suggestion": "Helpful suggestion for resolving the error",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-19T14:30:00",
  "conversationId": "conv_abc123xyz"
}
```

### Common Error Types

| Error Type | HTTP Status | Description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `InvalidQueryException` | 400 | Query is empty, too long, or malformed |
| `RateLimitExceededException` | 429 | User has exceeded rate limits |
| `LlmServiceException` | 503 | OpenAI API is unavailable or returned an error |
| `ToolExecutionException` | 500 | A tool failed to execute (e.g., database error) |
| `ChatbotException` | 500 | General chatbot error |
| `InternalServerError` | 500 | Unexpected server error |

---

## Authentication

All endpoints require JWT authentication. Include the JWT token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

To obtain a JWT token, use the authentication endpoints:
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login with email and password
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register a new user account

---

## Configuration

The AI Assistant can be configured using environment variables:

### OpenAI Configuration
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key (required)
- `OPENAI_MODEL` - Model to use (default: `gpt-4o-mini`)
- `OPENAI_TEMPERATURE` - Response creativity (default: `0.7`)
- `OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS` - Maximum response length (default: `1000`)
- `OPENAI_TIMEOUT_MS` - API timeout in milliseconds (default: `30000`)
- `OPENAI_MAX_RETRIES` - Number of retries on failure (default: `2`)

### Rate Limiting Configuration
- `RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE` - Requests per minute (default: `10`)
- `RATE_LIMIT_PER_HOUR` - Requests per hour (default: `100`)

## Best Practices

1. **Maintain Conversation Context**: Use the same `conversationId` for related queries to maintain context
2. **Be Specific**: More specific queries yield better results (e.g., include HS codes when known)
3. **Handle Rate Limits**: Implement exponential backoff when receiving 429 errors
4. **Check Health**: Monitor the `/health` endpoint to ensure service availability
5. **Error Handling**: Always handle errors gracefully and display user-friendly messages
